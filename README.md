## React.JS + Redux + TailwindCSS App

 - I created this app to demostrate a frontend dev work using *React, Redux and TailwindCSS* stack for an app that can:
1. Fetch products from an API backend.
2. Display them on the front end using flex classes from the tailwindcss framework.
3. Ability to add/remove products to a shopping cart and display cart totals.
4. Checkout using a single page checkout form and create an order to be serviced on the backend.
5. The backend will use Node.js + Express framework and MongoDB.
6. **Writing comprehensive tests for React UIs.**

## Requirements:
1. NodeJS 14+.
2. NPM to install dependencies.
3. MongoDB.
4. Access to a terminal window to execute commands.
